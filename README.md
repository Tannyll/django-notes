# Django Notes
I have been working on the web projects with Django for a long time. I created this repository to share my experiences with the new developers. You can find the related articles in [my blog](https://gokmengorgen.net/django-notlarim/). Sorry for Turkish, please encourage me to translate the articles into English.
